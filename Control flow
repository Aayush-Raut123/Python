#control flow
#using 3 techniques: sequencing, iteration and selection.
#make sure on indentation, python uses indentation to define code blocks.
#use the colon (:) to define the start of a code block.

#sequencing
#computer runs your code in order, from top to bottom.
print("3")
print("building")
print("blocks")
#output: 3
#building   
#blocks

#iteration
#repeating a block of code multiple times as a loop.
#Iteration makes your programs simpler, faster and reduces errors.
#There are two types of loops: for loop and while loop.

#using for loop
#A for loop is used to execute the same instruction over and over again, a specific number of times.
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
#output: 0
#1
#2
for i in range(3):
  print("A")   #print A 3 times     
print("B")     #print B once due to indentation

#using while loop
#A while loop is used to execute the same instruction over and over again, as long as a condition is true.
# they can be used even when you donâ€™t know how many iterations will be needed.
i=0   
while i<3:
    print(i)
    i+=1  #counter
#output: 0
#1
#2

#using break statement
i=0
while i<3:
    print(i)
    if i==1:
        break
    i+=1
#output: 0
#1

counter = 0
while counter < 4:
  print(counter)
  #an infinite loop

#using continue statement
i=0
while i<3:
    i+=1
    if i==1:
        continue
    print(i)        
#output: 2
#3


#selection
#Selection specifies when to follow each path.
#Selection is done using if, elif and else statements.
#The if statement is used to check a condition.
#The elif statement is used to check multiple conditions.
#The else statement is used to execute code when the condition is false.
#using if statement
age=18
if age>18:
    print("You are an adult")       
#output: nothing is printed because the condition is false

#using if and else statement
age=18
if age>18:
    print("You are an adult")       
else:
    print("You are a minor")
#output: You are a minor

#using if, elif and else statement

if age>18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age==18:

    print("You are a minor")
